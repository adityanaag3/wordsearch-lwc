# Word Search game built using Lightning Web Components

[Word Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_search) is a word puzzle video game in which the player must find all the words hidden in a grid. I've used [Lightning Web Components](https://lwc.dev) to build a version of this game, which you can play using the link below.  

## How to play?

Navigate to [this Heroku App](https://wordsearch-lwc.herokuapp.com/). Use any of the game code(s) below to start playing.

1. Get familiar with the game and controls: `example`.
1. Game Codes for Level 1 (Popular Salesforce abbreviations/acronyms): `a1`, `a2`.
1. Game Codes for Level 2 (Salesforce mascots/characters): `m1`, `m2`.
1. Game Codes for Level 3 (Salesforce Standard Objects): `o1`, `o2`.

Click on a letter to select/unselect. Select letters sequentially (up, down, left, right, across) to form a word, and once you think you found a word, click on **Check Word**.
